### Deforestation from a bird's eye view.

## About

This project is an attempt to bring awareness to the deforestation in the Amazon, through forming a connection between the user and the Amazon. By showing what deforestation looks like, the leading causes of deforestation, and deforestation rates, we hope to form a more comprehensive picture of our relationship with the Amazon.

To make this connection, datasets explored are:
[Prodes Deforestation in Amazonia](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::prodes-deforestation-in-amazonia/about)
