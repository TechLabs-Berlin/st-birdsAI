## About

**BirdsAI** is a web-app that attempts to raise awareness about the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, through forming a connection between the user and the Amazon. By showing what deforestation looks like, the leading causes of deforestation, and deforestation rates, we hope to form a more comprehensive picture of our relationship with the Amazon.

To make this connection, datasets explored are:
[Prodes Deforestation in Amazonia](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/datasets/gfw::prodes-deforestation-in-amazonia/about)
