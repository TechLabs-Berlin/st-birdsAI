**BirdsAI** is a web application that attempts to raise awareness about the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil through forming a connection between the user and the Amazon. By showing what deforestation looks like, the leading causes of deforestation, and deforestation rates, we hope to form a more comprehensive picture of our relationship with the Amazon. The web app is made for everyone, who is older than 6 years old – adults may show and explain it to children and adolescents – and have access to smartphones or computers. 


BirdsAI tells a story about the current and future state of the deforestation and the reasons behind it. It was developed as an interactive scrollytelling story, which combines data visualizations on maps, as well as charts, textual information and a deforestation area counter. As the user scrolls through the story, new chapters with content dynamically appear and change. Interaction with the story is encouraged, as different chapters include a slider element for displaying deforestation predictions per year, as well as dynamic charts, clickable markers on the map and popups that reveal additional data.
